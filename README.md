# Sample Code of Lieâ€“Trotter product formula

## Summary

This sample applies [Lie-Trotter product formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_product_formula) to 2 by 2 matrix, and sees orders of truncation errors.

Consider some operators X, Y, and Z, satisfying Z = X + Y.
Then the Lie-Trotter product formula is

Exp(h Z) = (Exp(h/n X) Exp(h/n Y))^n + O(h^2/n),

where n is a decomposition number and h is a c-number (usually a time-step).

This sample calculates both hand-sides and checks the truncation errors.
The truncation errors are determined by Frobenius norm.

## Usage

```
$ make
```
